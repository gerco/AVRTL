# AVRTL
AVR template library

Few days ago, I started my home project and wanted to use AVR microcontroller. I found a lot of information about hot to program it in C and assembler and almost nothing in C++. I started my own research and realize – most microcontroller developers very good know bit/bytes/code performance/size and thinking this why, but they do not think “abstract” way. When they think about C++ - in their mind it is heavy abstraction with virtual method and method’s overrides. Of course C++ will be rejected by this reason, but! ...

This library is my try to reach microcontroller world using power of C++ **templates**.
